# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently Librusek supports **all versions beyond 1.0**. All previous versions (v0.x) **are deprecated and shouldn't be used**.<br/>
Updating the app is important to keep it working with latest Librus API changes and/or features.<br/>
Starting from version 1.0, updates are **handled automatically within the app**.<br/>
