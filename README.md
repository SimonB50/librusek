# Librusek

Librusek is an alternative app for [Librus Synergia](https://synergia.librus.pl/), a popular school management system in Poland. It is designed to be more user-friendly and modern than the original website.

## Supported Synergia features
- **Logging in with Synergia**<br/>
  Librusek doesn't require you to create a Librus account, instead opting for the ability to login with your pre-existing Synergia account created for you by your school administrator.
- **Landing page**<br/>
All your account information, like your name, school and the current lucky number is available in one place.
- **Grades**<br/>
View your grades and averages for each subject. You can also see the grades added the day prior. <ins>Librusek supports both the traditional and points-based (percentages) grading systems.</ins>
- **Exams**<br/>
Know when your upcoming exams take place. You can view all your upcoming and previous exams along with their dates, all neatly sorted and highlighted for your convenience.
- **Timetable**<br/>
Stay up-to-date with your daily schedule. You can view your timetable for each week, including all substitutions and cancelled classes.
